## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
  - tried use one ul for scale
- CSS custom properties
  - mainly flexbox
  - a bit messy CSS file
- JavaScrip
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I have tried to use REM(sometime EM units to get flow with them), also tried create more that 1 function i JS responding to each other. In HTMl I have tried using conteiners for each section for better data manegment. Also, used ul to create scale.

Function which I'm pround of:
  listItem.forEach(li => li.style.backgroundColor = "")

Now I understand short functions a little more.

### Continued development

Make my CSS file less messy, maybe try use framework for styling.
